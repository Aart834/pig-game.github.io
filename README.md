# pig-game
This is a game like Ludo. you can play this game rollling dice by clicking on it.

I made this website using dom manipulation , js.
Css3 is used for styling. 
purple and red gradient is used for background in title section a pig 🐷 logo is given to make my game more cute .
for structure HTML5 is used.

rules for playing
here 2 players rolls the dice whom scored 100 will win
but if you get 1 your current score will be 0(zero).
you can save your points by clicking on the hold button. 



I hope you enjoy this game and win.
ALL THE BEST👍
